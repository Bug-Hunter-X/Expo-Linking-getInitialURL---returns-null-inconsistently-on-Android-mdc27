This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` async function sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is opened, especially on Android devices. This leads to unexpected behavior in the application as it doesn't process the intended URL.  The inconsistency makes it difficult to reliably handle deep links, causing a significant problem in the user experience.
